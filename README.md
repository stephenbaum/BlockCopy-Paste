# BlockCopy-Paste
Javascript code that eliminates users' ability to copy and paste responses into Qualtrics text boxes.
I have found this to be particularly useful when users' see prompts that ask them to reflect on a memory (either as a manipulation or a memory).
This helps to minimize the extent to which users can lean on ChatGPT to craft responses and then copy and paste those responses.
